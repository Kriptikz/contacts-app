# # This is a standard Dockerfile for building a Go app.
# # It is a multi-stage build: the first stage compiles the Go source into a binary, and
# #   the second stage copies only the binary into an alpine base.

# # Compile the app.
# FROM golang:1.12-alpine as builder
# WORKDIR /app
# # The build context is set to the directory where the repo is cloned.
# # This will copy all files in the repo to /app inside the container.
# # If your app requires the build context to be set to a subdirectory inside the repo, you
# #   can use the source_dir app spec option, see: <https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/reference/app-specification-reference/>
